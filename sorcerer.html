                <p><b>Health per Level:</b> 6 + Constitution </p> 
                <p><b>Health Die:</b> 1d10 per Level</p>
                <h3>Mana Manipulation:</h3>
                <p>When you choose this class, you can as a Bonus Action manipulate latent mana, adding a die equal to your Intelligence in Magic damage to your next Trait ability or unarmed attack. This increases to two die at level 8, and three die at level 16.</p>
                <h3>Perfect Impact:</h3>
                <p>When you roll a Critical Attack with an unarmed strike, Mana Manipulation is automatically applied for the next 20 seconds. Your Critical Range then expands by one.  Getting another critical with an unarmed strike during this time resets the timer, and expands your Critical Range by 1 again, and it repeats until your attacks are Critical on all but a 1. Then, the timer resets on a Critical Attack, but your Critical Range no longer expands.</p>
                <h3>Innate Talent</h3>:</h3>
                <p>You can choose one Sorcerous Talent trait for free upon picking this Class. You gain the Innate ability of this trait.</p>

If someone walks through them, the doors automatically close on them, dealing 3d6 force damage. You can use a Reaction at any point to close them early, creating an impassable magic barrier, or use your Main Action to create them around a target, immediately dealing the damage. All doors disappear at the start of your next turn.</p> 
<p>If you chose this as your Innate Talent, you can place two of these doors as a Bonus Action and can connect two of the doors, causing them to become linked. If anything passes through one, it appears out of the other. Linked doors don't deal damage unless you use a Reaction to close it on a person passing through the door.</p>

Additionally, rather than just teleporting, you can swap places with another creature in range or swap the places of two creatures within range.</p>
