                <h3>Health</h3>
                <p><b>Health per Level:</b> 6 + Constitution </p> 
                <p><b>Health Die:</b> 1d10 per Level</p>
                <h3>Mana Manipulation:</h3>
                <p>When you choose this class, you can as a Bonus Action manipulate latent mana, adding a die equal to your Mind die in Magic damage to your next Trait ability or unarmed attack. This increases to two die at level 8, and three die at level 16.</p>
                <h3>Perfect Impact:</h3>
                <p>When you roll a Critical Attack with an unarmed strike, Mana Manipulation is automatically applied for the next 20 seconds. Your Critical Range then expands by one. Getting another critical with an unarmed strike during this time resets the timer, and expands your Critical Range by 1 again, and it repeats until your attacks are Critical on all but a 1. Then, the timer resets on a Critical Attack, but your Critical Range no longer expands.</p>
                <h3>Innate Talent:</h3>
                <p>You can choose one Sorcerous Talent trait for free upon picking this Class. You gain the Innate ability of this trait.</p>
                <h3> 1st Level Traits</h3>

                <p><b>Arcane Gate</b> (Cost 2):</p>
<p>Type: Sorcerous Talent</p>
<p>As a Bonus Action, you can create a set of 2 meter by 1 meter (6 x 3 ft) doors somewhere within sight. If someone walks through them, the doors automatically close on them, dealing 3d4 Force damage. You can use a Reaction at any point to close them early, creating an impassable magic barrier, or use your Main Action to create them around a target, immediately dealing the damage. All doors disappear at the start of your next turn.</p> 
<p>If you chose this as your Innate Talent, you can place two of these doors as a Bonus Action and can connect two of the doors, causing them to become linked. If anything passes through one, it appears out of the other. Linked doors don't deal damage unless you use a Reaction to close it on a person passing through the door.</p>

<p><b>Counterspell</b> (Cost 2):</p>
<p>Type: Reaction</p>
<p>When targeted by any Trait ability, you may choose to use your Reaction to negate the effect. It costs 1 charge to block a 1st level trait, 2 charges for a 6th level trait, 3 for a 13th level, and 4 for a 17th level trait. This has charges equal to your Aura Score per encounter.</p>

<p><b>Curse Infusion</b> (Cost 1):</p>
<p>Type: Bonus Action</p>
<p>As a Bonus Action, you can infuse an object with mana, adding an additional 1d6 force damage to the next attack with it and making it have a detectable amount of magic. If your Innate Talent is Plane Shifter, this infused object can be a target for swapping places with for 20 seconds.</p>

<p><b>Mitigate Damage</b> (Cost 2):</p>
<p>Type: Passive</p>
<p>When you use Health Die to heal, you heal additional Health equal to your Aura score per die spent.</p>

<p><b>Mystic Aura</b> (Cost 2):</p>
<p>Type: Passive</p>
<p>You can add an additional Magic damage equal to half your Aura Score to any unarmed attack or sorcerer Trait. Additionally, your Armor is increased by 1. These abilities can be turned on and off as a Bonus Action, but while active you also exude a large amount of magic that can be easily detected even without magic detection. You can however use this to your advantage by infusing your aura with menace, giving you a +2 advantage on Intimidation checks.</p>

<p><b>Plane Shifter</b> (Cost 2):</p>
<p>Type: Sorcerous Talent</p>
<p>As a Bonus Action, you can teleport 5 meters (16 ft) in any direction.</p>
<p>If you chose this as your Innate Talent, you can use this as a Reaction to being attacked, and when you use it as a Bonus Action, if you teleport within 1 meter (3 ft) of another creature, you can immediately make an unarmed attack without using any kind of action. Additionally, rather than just teleporting, you can swap places with another creature in range or swap the places of two creatures within range.</p>

<p><b>Rough Mana</b> (Cost 2):</p>
<p>Type: Sorcerous Talent</p>
<p>As a Bonus Action, you can fire a projectile within 10 meters (33 ft) that deals 2d6 Magic damage. Additionally, as a Reaction, you can make a Shield that adds a +2 to your Armor until the start of your next turn.</p>
<p>If you chose this as your Innate Talent, you use your Main Action to shoot a forceball with a 10 meter radius within 30 meters of you. Everyone in the radius must make a Difficulty 10 Dexterity check or take 4d8 Explosive damage, half as much on a success.</p>

<p><b>Shadow Manipulation</b> (Cost 2):</p>
<p>Type: Sorcerous Talent</p>
<p>As a Bonus Action, you can make the area around you become shrouded in darkness, giving all creatures within 10 meters (33 ft) other than you a -4 disadvantage on their attacks and Perception checks.</p>
<p>If you chose this as your Innate Talent, during your Movement Actions, you can traverse through the shadows. There must be darkness for you to move through, and if you do move through the shadows, you cannot be attacked and can teleport to other shadows within sight. You are immediately sent out of the shadows at the end of your turn.</p>

<p><b>Quickened Mana</b> (Cost 2):</p>
<p>Type: Free Action</p>
<p>You can choose to lose the effects of Mana Manipulation if you have it activated to turn a Main Action trait into a Bonus Action trait.</p>

<p><b>Third Eye</b> (Cost 2):</p>
<p>Type: Sorcerous Talent</p>
<p>You can see into the Ethereal Plane, allowing you to see ghosts and other spirits. Additionally, any magic user or magic item has a faint glowing aura off of them for you. </p>
<p>Additionally, if you choose this as your Innate Talent, as a Bonus Action, you can reveal all magic that has its aura suppressed from magic detection in a 15 meter (49 ft) radius. Also, you can choose a creature within 15 meters (49 ft) as a Bonus Action to become the target of your Overwhelming Sight. The target is filled with visions of ghosts and spirits and is considered Stunned until the end of your turn.</p>

                <h3> 6th Level Traits</h3>
<p><b>Arcane Camouflage</b> (Cost 2):</p>
<p>Type: Main Action</p>
<p>You can turn yourself entirely invisible, completely obscuring yourself from vision. You gain the Invisible Status Effect. The effect lasts for 1 minute.</p>

                
<p><b>Butterfly Bullets</b> (Cost 1):</p>
<p>Type: Bonus Action</p>
<p>As a Bonus Action, you can create 3 missiles that deal 1d6 + your Mind die in Magical damage.</p>

                
<p><b>Chant of Empowerment</b> (Cost 2):</p>
<p>Type: Main Action</p>
<p>By channeling your inner mana through a rhythmic chant, you can enhance the potency of your abilities. As a Main Action, you can begin chanting to empower a specific Sorcerer Trait you intend to use on your next turn. For each additional Bonus Action spent chanting, the empowered Trait gains increased effects. You can chant for up to six additional actions. You must still use the required action of the Trait upon activation.</p>
<p><b>Chanting Effects:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>One Additional Action: The empowered Trait deals an additional 2d6 Magic damage.</li>
    <li>Two Additional Actions: The empowered Trait deals an additional 3d6 Magic damage.</li>
    <li>Three Additional Actions: The empowered Trait deals an additional 4d6 Magic damage and the target has disadvantage on saving throws against it.</li>
    <li>Four Additional Actions: The empowered Trait deals an additional 5d6 Magic damage and the target has disadvantage on saving throws against it.</li>
    <li>Six Additional Actions: The empowered Trait deals an additional 6d6 Magic damage, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against it, and all creatures within 5 meters (16 ft) of the targets take half the damage dealt.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Midas Touch</b> (Cost 2):</p>
<p>Type: Bonus Action</p>
<p>When you touch an item, you can transmute its element as a Bonus Action. You can only transmute the material to another material of a similar density. You cannot create or destroy material during this process.</p>

<p><b>Phantom Fazers</b> (Cost 1):</p>
<p>Type: Movement Action</p>
<p>You become incorporeal for the Movement Action and can move up to half your speed; however, moving through creatures and solid objects requires twice the speed as moving normally.</p>

<p><b>Echoes</b> (Cost 1):</p>
<p>Type: Reaction</p>
<p>When you deal damage with an unarmed strike, as a Reaction at any point you can cause the target to take the same damage a second time, this time as entirely Magic damage.</p>

<p><b>Simple Domain</b> (Cost 2):</p>
<p>Type: Double Action</p>
<p>You can activate a 12 meter (40 ft) radius Simple Domain as a Double Action. It remains for 30 seconds, and while active all of your Sorcerer Traits ignore Armor against other creatures within the area.</p>
<p>If you have an Innate Talent, you gain the Expanded Domain of its type below. It requires an additional Double Action and can be used Once per Encounter:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Arcane Gate:</b> You create an expansive 15 meter (49 ft) radius arcane nexus around you, filled with swirling magical gates. Within this domain, you can summon additional gates, each dealing 3d10 force damage to any creature that passes through. Each creature who moves must roll a Mind check with a Difficulty of 10. If they fail, you decide where they end their Movement. Additionally, you can use a Bonus Action to close all gates, trapping any creatures within them and causing them to take an additional 5d10 force damage.</li>
    <li><b>Plane Shifter:</b> You create a 20 meter (66 ft) radius field that distorts space and time. Within this domain, you can teleport anywhere or swap places with anyone in the area without using any action up to 3 times per turn. Enemies within the field must make an Intelligence check or become disoriented, taking 3d10 Magic damage, gaining a -4 disadvantage on Perception checks and attacks, and becoming unable to use any trait abilities for 1 minute.</li>
    <li><b>Rough Mana:</b> All your Sorcerer Traits cause creatures to automatically fail their checks against them, and their damage is doubled.</li>
    <li><b>Third Eye:</b> You unlock a profound vision that extends to a 30 meter (98 ft) radius around you. Within this area, all hidden and invisible creatures become visible, and all magical auras are revealed. Any creature within the radius must make a DC 10 Intelligence check or be overwhelmed by visions, granting a -5 disadvantage to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Additionally, you gain complete knowledge of all active magic effects and can dispel any magic within the area by spending a Reaction, learning their names, damage types, sources, and more.</li>
    <li><b>Shadow Manipulation:</b> You enshroud a 20 meter (66 ft) radius area in impenetrable darkness, creating a realm of shadows. All light sources within the domain are extinguished, rendering the area in complete darkness. Enemies within the realm must make a Constitution check or suffer 5d10 Void damage upon activation, or half as much on a fail. Shadowy tendrils lash out from the darkness, dealing 2d10 Void damage to any creature that starts its turn within the domain.</li>
</ul>
                <h3> 13th Level Traits</h3>

<p>Type: Main Action</p>

<p><b>Soul-Ripping Slash</b> (Cost 2):</p>
<p>Type: Main Action</p>
<p>As a Main Action, you choose a creature within 10 meters (33 ft) and an incorporeal slash rips through their body, dealing 3d10 + your Mind die in Magical damage. The attack ignores Armor. As a Double Action, once per encounter, you can triple the damage, dealing 9d10 + your Mind die in Magical damage instead.</p>

                <h3> 17th Level Traits</h3>
<p><b>Arcane Master</b> (Cost 4):</p>
<p>Type: Passive</p>

<p>You use a free action to regain all of your Sorcerer abilities, and have 10 actions this turn, no longer having a cap on how many Main Actions you can use. After this turn ends, you drop to 0 health and are unable to be healed by traits or items for 10 years.</p>
