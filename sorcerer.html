                <h3>Health</h3>
                <p><b>Base Health:</b> 20 + Constitution Score</p> 
                <p><b>Health per Level:</b> 2 per Level</p>
                <p><b>Health Die:</b> 1d12 per Level</p>
                <h3>Mana Manipulation:</h3>
                <p>When you choose this class, you can as a Bonus Action manipulate latent mana, adding a die equal to your Mind die in Magic damage to your next Trait ability or unarmed attack. This increases to two die at level 8, and three die at level 16.</p>
                <h3>Perfect Impact:</h3>
                <p>When you roll a Critical Attack with an unarmed strike, Mana Manipulation is automatically applied for the next 20 seconds, and your Initiative Type switches to Clash Initiative without using a Shift. Your Critical Range then expands by one. Getting another critical with an unarmed strike during this time resets the timer for both, and expands your Critical Range by 1 again, and it repeats until your attacks are Critical on all but a 1. Then, the timer resets on a Critical Attack, but your Critical Range no longer expands.</p>
                <h3>Innate Talent:</h3>
                <p>You can choose one Sorcerous Talent trait for free upon picking this Class. You gain the Innate ability of this trait.</p>
                <h3> 1st Level Traits</h3>

                <p><b>Arcane Gate</b> (Cost 2):</p>
<p>Type: Sorcerous Talent</p>
<p>As a Bonus Action, you can create a set of 2 meter by 1 meter (6 ft x 3 ft) doors somewhere within sight. If someone walks through them, the doors automatically close on them, dealing 3d4 Force damage. You can use a Reaction at any point to close them early, creating an impassable magic barrier, or use your Main Action to create them around a target, immediately dealing the damage. All doors disappear at the start of your next turn.</p> 
<p>If you chose this as your Innate Talent, you can place two of these doors as a Bonus Action and can connect two of the doors, causing them to become linked. If anything passes through one, it appears out of the other. Linked doors don't deal damage unless you use a Reaction to close it on a person passing through the door.</p>
    
<p><b>Beyond Magic</b> (Cost 2):</p>
<p>Type: Passive</p>
<p>You may choose either Explosive, Void, Divine, or Psychic. You may only choose once when you choose this trait and cannot change it again. You may choose for all Magic damage dealt by you during your turn to become the damage type you chose.</p>
     
<p><b>Counterspell</b> (Cost 2):</p>
<p>Type: Reaction</p>
<p>When targeted by any Trait ability, you may choose to use your Reaction to negate the effect. It costs 1 charge to block a 1st level trait, 2 charges for a 6th level trait, 3 for a 13th level, and 4 for a 17th level trait. This has charges equal to your Aura Score per encounter.</p>

<p>Type: Bonus Action</p>

These abilities can be turned on and off as a Bonus Action, but while active you also exude a large amount of magic that can be easily detected even without magic detection. You can however use this to your advantage by infusing your aura with menace, giving you a +2 advantage on Intimidation checks.</p>

<p><b>Plane Shifter</b> (Cost 2):</p>
<p>Type: Sorcerous Talent</p>
<p>As a Bonus Action, you can teleport 5 meters (16 ft) in any direction.</p>
<p>If you chose this as your Innate Talent, you can use this as a Reaction to being attacked, and when you use it as a Bonus Action, if you teleport within 1 meter (3 ft) of another creature, you can immediately make an unarmed attack without using any kind of action. Additionally, rather than just teleporting, you can swap places with another creature in range or swap the places of two creatures within range.</p>

<p><b>Rough Mana</b> (Cost 2):</p>
<p>Type: Sorcerous Talent</p>
<p>As a Bonus Action, you can fire a projectile within 10 meters (33 ft) that deals 2d6 Magic damage. Additionally, as a Reaction, you can make a Shield that adds a +2 to your Armor until the start of your next turn.</p>

<p>Type: Sorcerous Talent</p>
<p>As a Bonus Action, you can make the area around you become shrouded in darkness, giving all creatures within 10 meters (33 ft) other than you a -4 disadvantage on their attacks and Perception checks.</p>
<p>If you chose this as your Innate Talent, during your Movement Actions, you can traverse through the shadows. There must be darkness for you to move through, and if you do move through the shadows, you cannot be attacked and can teleport to other shadows within sight. You are immediately sent out of the shadows at the end of your turn.</p>

<p><b>Quickened Mana</b> (Cost 2):</p>
<p>Type: Free Action</p>
<p>You can choose to lose the effects of Mana Manipulation if you have it activated to turn a Main Action trait into a Bonus Action trait.</p>

<p><b>Third Eye</b> (Cost 2):</p>
<p>Type: Sorcerous Talent</p>
<p>You can see into the Ethereal Plane, allowing you to see ghosts and other spirits. Additionally, any magic user or magic item has a faint glowing aura off of them for you. </p>
