                <p> Pulse is a TTRPG built for high power, dynamic gameplay with a focus on player expression. This section explains the core rules of Pulse and is the best place to start when first learning.
All rolls in Pulse are determined by the roll of a die, using different stats dice to determine the outcome. Each stat has a type of die assigned to it by you during character creation. These range from a d4 (Four-sided die) to a d12 (Twelve-sided die). They can be improved later. A character in Pulse has 5 core stats:<p>
<li>Power: The physical might of your character.</li>
<li>Dexterity: The agility and reflexes of your character.</li>
<li>Constitution: The physical fortitude of your character.</li>
<li>Mind: Your characters intelligence.</li>
<li>Aura: Your characters force of will and charisma.</li>
<p>If an ability or Trait calls for your Attributes "Score" its referring to the maximum number on your die. For example, if you had a d6 Power, your Power Score is 6.
These are the stats that determine how your character plays. There are other modifiers that can affect how you roll as well, called Advantage or Disadvantage. These are an increase or decrease to your roll determined by your Game Master based on your current situation. You won't always have them, but they will probably be fairly common.</p>

              <h3>Combat</h3>
              <p> In combat, your character has 2 actions on its turn. It can choose from the following actions:</p>
<li>Main Action - Your attack, spell, special abilities, etc.. You can only do one of these on your turn.</li>
<li>Movement Action - You can move equal to your characters speed.</li>
<li>Bonus Action - Abilities from your class and other features may be a bonus action.</li>
<li>Double Action - Major effects that require both actions.</li>
<li>Free Action - Minor effects that require no action.</li>
<p>The only Bonus Action you have outside of your classes is Health Surge. This allows you to roll any number of Health Die and regain that much health.</p>

                <p><b>Attacks and Damage</b></p>  
                <p>Pulse uses a simplified single roll attack system. You will roll the die for your weapon, and add all of your modifiers. This is not only the damage, but also the roll to hit. 
   <p>Example: Greataxe | 3d4 + Power (1d8) </p>
      <p>You roll and get three 2's and a 4, your total is 10 If the targets Armor is lower than or equal to 10 you hit and deal 10 damage.</p>
                    
<p>If you roll max damage on all dice other than your Attribute die, you make a Critical Attack, which doubles the total damage, Certain classes, like the Fighter and Bully can increase their critical attack range. If an ability adds extra dice to your attack, they don't effect the critical attack chance, you only need to roll max on the weapons dice.
Your weapons will also have different properties that benefit different characters and playstyles. Most magic attacks hit automatically, or require the target to roll a check against them, so espers or magic users won't have to worry about rolling to hit very often.</p>
<p>When you drop to 0 hit points, if you have Health Die left, you body expends all the leftover dice healing you for that much. If you don't have any Health Die left, you remain unconscious for 1 hour, and if you take damage equal to twice your Level while unconscious you are officially dead.</p>
                <p><b>Reactionary Attacks</b></p>  
                <p>Sometimes you can make an Attack using your Reaction. Typically, this is when a creature enters or leaves your attack range. However, some abilities grant creatures immunity to attacks, and some abilities grant you the ability to make a Reactionary Attack under different circumstances.
</p>
<p><b>Other Actions</b></p>  
                <p>Aid:</p>
                <p>You can use your Main Action to aid a creature, granting them a +3 advantage on their next roll. The target of your Aid must be within 5 meters (16 ft).
</p>

                <p>Disarm:</p>
                <p>You can replace an attack with a Disarm. Choose a target within melee range, you both roll a Dexterity check. If you roll higher, they drop their weapon, if you fail, nothing happens.
</p>

                <p>Dodge: </p>
                <p>Using a Movement Action on your turn you can Dodge, this allows you to roll a Dexterity check and add half the roll to your Armor. You cannot use this more than once on your turn, even if other abilities may seem to allow it.
</p>
                <p> Draw Weapon:</p>
                <p>You can equip a new weapon and/or put away your current weapon as a Bonus Action on your turn.</p>

                <p> Grab:</p>
                <p> When you attack, you can instead grab a creature, you simply roll a Power check against its Armor. If you succeed, the creature is grabbed. As a free action on the turn you grabbed them, you can choose one of the following options:</p>
<li>Toss - You throw them up to 5 meters (16 ft) in any direction.</li>
<li>Hold - You make them unable to use reactions and movement.</li>
<li>Carry - You carry them over shoulder halving you speed.</li>

                <p> Health Surge:</p>
                <p> You may roll any number of Health Die, and regain the amount rolled. You regain all Health Die once you rest.</p>

                <p> Hide:</p>
                <p>Using your Main Action to Hide, you roll a Stealth check, and to be found a creature must use a Free Action to Investigate and beat your Stealth check with its Investigation check.</p>

               
                <p>Investigation:</p>
                <p>As a Free Action, you can Investigate once on your turn. This requires you to roll an Perception check, and you may find things in the environment that you didn't notice before.</p>
 <p>Jump:</p>
                <p>As a Movement Action you can Jump. As a base, not including any Traits that may effect it, you can jump a number of meters forward or backward equal to your Power or Dexterity Score, and vertically half of that. You don't have to jump your maximum amount.</p>

                <p>Using a Trait:</p>
                <p>Many Traits are different kinds of Actions, including all the kinds listed above. Using them requires the action listed.</p>
<p> Use Item:</p>
                <p>You can use any item using your Main Action, such as a magic item or a grenade.</p>

                <p><b>Status Effects:</b></p>

                <p>Bleed</p>
                <p>When first applied, Bleed has no effect. If you are hit 5 times with a Bleed effect, on the 5th hit you take damage equal 15% of your Health Maximum.</p>
                <p> Disease </p>
                <p>Each turn after Disease is applied you take 1d10 damage until you heal at least 1 Health or have it removed in another manner.</p>
                <p> Fear </p>
                <p>When Fear is applied, you have disadvantage on Mind checks and disadvantage on attacks against the creature or item that gave the effect to you.</p>
                <p> Freeze </p>
                <p> When applied, you are unable to move or take actions for each turn the effect lasts. If you drop to 0 Health while frozen you cannot use Health Die and immediately die.</p>
                <p> Inspired </p>
                <p>You have a +2 on attacks and checks while the effect is applied.</p>
                <p> Invisible </p>
                <p>While applied, all creatures automatically fail all checks to find you, until you have attacked at least once. They then only have a -3 Disadvantage.</p>
                <p> Psycho </p>
                <p>While applied you automatically fail Mind checks and are unable to move or use Reactions.</p>
                <p> Slowed </p>
                <p>Your Speed is halved each time Slow is applied. You speed will be 1/2 of max, and then 1/4, then 1/8 etcetera.</p>
                <p> Stunned </p>
                <p>When applied you are unable to move, or use any kind of Action (including Reactions), and automatically fail all Mind and Dexterity checks.</p>

                Although it doesn't have all the properties of a traditional Status Effect, another effect that can be used on your character or you can use on others is Knocked or Knockdown. When a creature is Knocked, the become unable to move or use actions during the turn they were Knocked, their speed is halved, and they cannot attack until they get up. They can then use a Movement Action to restand themselves on their turn.
